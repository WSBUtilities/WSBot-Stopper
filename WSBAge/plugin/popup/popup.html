        <p>WSBot Stopper is set up. The date an account joined WallStreetBets should be listed by the username.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind that this plugin only works on r/WallStreetBets. Support for other subreddits may be added in the future.</p>
        <p>A planned improvement to this plugin is accounts having "trust scores" indicating how likely it is that they are bots. If you are interested in this feature, please consider donating.</p>
